# Java Hash Exercise

This is an autograder for an in-class exercise on hash functions that I created
for CS 2510: Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 at Mills College at Northeastern
University. Its purpose is to:

* illustrate how user-written hash functions affect hash set performance
* challenge students to think about what makes a good hash function for a given
  corpus

## Classroom use

The recommended usage is:

1. Going over the implementation of [HashSet.java](src/main/java/HashSet.java)
   with students, showing them how the `hashCode()` function is used.
2. Discussing the contract for `hashCode()`, which requires `equals()` objects
   to have equal hash codes. Point out that this is a legal implementation but
   that it will lead to maximal collisions, reducing the set table's performance
   to that of a linked list:

```java
@Override
public int hashCode(){
    return 42;
}
```

3. Providing students with [MyString.java](src/main/java/MyString.java) and
   challenge them to write a better hash function without calling any existing
   implementations of `hashCode()`. (It is up to you whether to provide any
   examples of good hash functions or allow them access to online resources.)
4. Having students submit their files to a Gradescope assignment you create for
   immediate feedback on the number of collisions their function causes on a
   hidden (or visible) corpus.
5. Sharing the implementations that perform the best, either in that class
   session or the next one.

## Creating the Gradescope assignment

Follow [video instructions to create a Gradescope
assignment](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e634c84d-611f-4958-a79e-b011012b70c5),
which can be summarized as follows:

1. Download `autograder.zip` from the latest release or build your zip file
   by cloning this repository and running `./make_autograder.sh`.
2. Create
   a [Programming Assignment](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ujutnle52h-instructor-assignment-programming)
   on Gradescope, enabling a leaderboard.
3. Configuring the autograder, which includes:
    1. Selecting the latest Ubuntu image.
    2. Selecting JDK 17.
    3. Uploading `autograder.zip`.
    4. Clicking on `Update Autograder`.
    5. Uploading a test submission from
       a [sample-submissions](sample-submissions)
       subdirectory.

## Customizations

Here are ideas for customizing the assignment:

1. Replacing the corpus (currently a list of winners of SIGCSE prizes) with
   another corpus, such as the names of your students.
2. De-generifying `HashSet` to simplify the code.
3. Varying the capacity of the hash set to distinguish among different types
   of collisions, such as those due to the number buckets and those due to
   identical `hashCode()` values.

## Recommended Reading

Anyone interested in hash functions, especially for Java, should read
**Item 11: Always override hashCode when you override equals** in
*Effective Java* (3rd edition) by Joshua Bloch (Pearson, 2018).

The [Java 1 `String.hashCode()` implementation](
https://github.com/barismeral/Java-JDK-1.0-src/blob/master/src/java/lang/String.java)
is an interesting historical relic that has the curious
property of O(1) runtime.
